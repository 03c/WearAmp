# Deployment

WearAmp is deployed to Google Play via GitHub Actions. Every merge to `main` automatically builds a signed release AAB and uploads it to the **Internal Testing** track.

## How it works

The workflow lives at [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) and runs on every push to `main`. It:

1. Decodes the release keystore from a base64-encoded GitHub secret.
2. Computes a `versionCode` as `(run_number * 1000) + run_attempt` — this auto-increments on every run so you never touch it.
3. Reads `versionName` from [`version.properties`](../version.properties) — bump this manually before each meaningful release.
4. Builds a signed release AAB with `./gradlew :app:bundleRelease`.
5. Creates a GitHub Release and attaches the AAB.
6. Uploads the AAB to the **Internal Testing** track on Google Play for package `com.wearamp`.

## One-time setup

### 1 — Generate a release keystore

Do this once and keep the file somewhere safe (not in the repo).

```bash
keytool -genkey -v \
  -keystore wearamp-release.jks \
  -alias wearamp \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Base64-encode it so it can be stored as a GitHub secret:

```bash
# macOS
base64 -i wearamp-release.jks | tr -d '\n'

# Linux
base64 -w 0 wearamp-release.jks
```

### 2 — Create a Google Play service account

1. Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select (or create) a project.
2. Enable the **Google Play Android Developer API**.
3. Go to **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts** and create a new service account (e.g. `github-deploy`).
4. Create a JSON key for that service account and download it.
5. Open [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) → **Setup → API access**.
6. Link the Google Cloud project you used above.
7. Find the service account in the list and click **Grant access**.
8. Assign the **Release manager** permission (or at minimum **Release to Internal Testing**).

### 3 — Add GitHub Secrets

In your repository go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret name | Value |
|---|---|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded content of `wearamp-release.jks` (step 1) |
| `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD` | The keystore password you set in step 1 |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | `wearamp` (or whatever alias you used) |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | The key password you set in step 1 |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` | Full JSON content of the service account key from step 2 |

### 4 — First upload (manual)

Google Play requires at least one manually uploaded AAB before the API can push subsequent updates. Build a release AAB locally (with your keystore environment variables set) or via Android Studio, then upload it to the **Internal Testing** track in Play Console for package `com.wearamp`. After that, every merge to `main` is handled automatically.

## Bumping the version name

Edit [`version.properties`](../version.properties) and update `VERSION_NAME` before merging:

```properties
VERSION_NAME=1.1.0
```

The `versionCode` is always derived from the GitHub Actions run number and never needs manual changes.

---

## CI (pull requests)

The [`ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow runs on every pull request targeting `main` and:

- Builds a debug APK
- Runs unit tests
- Runs Android Lint
